    "`collections.namedtuple` is a function that generates a subclass of tuple with named fields. Namedtuples help to have meaning in each position in a tuple. This provides the functionality of tuples and adds the ability to access fields by name instead of position.\n",
    "\n",
    "A namedtuple is a good fit when you're dealing with a large number of attributes in an object. It enhances readability and understanding of the code. For instance, if you have a point in a 2D space, instead of remembering the index of x and y in a tuple, you can just refer to them by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Namedtuples can also be a good alternative to dictionaries, as they consume less memory. They are immutable, which can be beneficial in a multi-threading environment where you don't want data to be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have a database of employees, where each record contains an employee's id, name, and job title. You can use a namedtuple to represent each employee record:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import namedtuple\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a namedtuple type 'Employee' with fields 'id', 'name', 'job_title'\n",
    "Employee = namedtuple('Employee', 'id name job_title')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assume we get the following data from the database\n",
    "data_from_db = [\n",
    "    (1, 'Alice', 'Software Engineer'),\n",
    "    (2, 'Bob', 'Data Scientist'),\n",
    "    (3, 'Charlie', 'Product Manager')\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the database data to a list of Employee namedtuples\n",
    "employees = [Employee(*row) for row in data_from_db]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now we can access the data in a more readable way\n",
    "for employee in employees:\n",
    "    print(f'Employee {employee.id} is {employee.name} and works as a {employee.job_title}.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, we first define an `Employee` namedtuple with fields `id`, `name`, `job_title`. Then we retrieve data from the database (simulated here with a list of tuples) and convert each record to an `Employee` namedtuple. This makes the data easier to work with: instead of having to remember that the job title is the third element of the tuple, we can just write `employee.job_title`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful when working with large datasets where each record may contain many fields. Using namedtuples makes your code more readable and self-descriptive.\n"
